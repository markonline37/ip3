			The roles I played in this project are that of a developer and report writer. My previous programming experiences have mostly been with java, but I have done web development before. Javascript is not new to me, but my experiences with ajax were limited before I started working on this project. The JSON file format was also relatively new to me, but my work on this project has also helped build my experience in this area. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Most of my work was done on the earthquake and movie visualizations. This mainly includes selection of the APIs and writing of the javascript and php files.
